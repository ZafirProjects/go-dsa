# go-dsa
The primeagen's course on data structures and algorithms written in Go.

The maps, heaps, and trees folder are not entirely done yet.
The tests for the data structures and algorithms are not comprehensive.

To use the program, run:
```
go test
```
in any of the sub-directories (arrays, stacks...)
